##Search code
Find file contents via various criteria. 
(This method returns up to 100 results per page.)

###Considerations for code search
Due to the complexity of searching code, there are a few restrictions on how searches are performed:

- Only the default branch is considered. In most cases, this will be the master branch.
- Only files smaller than 384 KB are searchable.
- You must always include at least one search term when searching source code. For example, searching for language:go is not valid, while amazing language:go is.

The `q` search term can also contain any combination of the supported code search qualifiers as described by the in-browser code search documentation and search syntax documentation:

- `in` Qualifies which fields are searched. With this qualifier you can restrict the search to the file contents (file), the file path (path), or both.
- `language` Searches code based on the language itâ€™s written in.
- `fork` Specifies that code from forked repositories should be searched (true). Repository forks will not be searchable unless the fork has more stars than the parent repository.
- `size` Finds files that match a certain size (in bytes).
- `path` Specifies the path prefix that the resulting file must be under.
- `filename` Matches files by a substring of the filename.
- `extension` Matches files with a certain extension after a dot.
- `user` or `repo` Limits searches to a specific user or repository.
